# Happy Thoughts

This project focus on changes in state or a component mounting using useEffect in React. And what it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from.

## The problem

Working with the material, the previous projects and example projects worked well together. It was a lot of learning from the previous projects that applied here as well
and made me understand the previous work better. If I had more time I would add animations on new thoughts and learn how to store amount of likes.
